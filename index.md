I am a doctoral student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/) and currently working with [Prof. Archana Venkataraman](https://engineering.jhu.edu/nsa/) in the [Malone Centre for Engineering in Healthcare](https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/). My current research interest focuses on developing machine learning tools to efficiently integrate multimodal imaging-genetics data while interpreting the underlying etiology of the disease. This is a joint collaboration work with [Lieber Institute of Brain Development](https://www.libd.org).

Prior coming to JHU I graduated with First Class Honours from the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/). During my undergrad, I was involved in a number of research projects at Jadavpur University, India and [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/), Canada.
I am deeply passionate about machine learning, artificial intelligence, human-computer interactions and its application in healthcare.
