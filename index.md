I am a doctoral student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/) and currently working with [Prof. Archana Venkataraman](https://engineering.jhu.edu/nsa/) in the [Malone Centre for Engineering in Healthcare](https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/). My research involves complex, high-dimensional, and structured data analysis with an application focus on computational biology and genomics. Current contributions include novel models to embed structured data as graphs to regularize whole-brain whole-genome data for pattern detection and feature selection. This is a joint collaboration work with [Lieber Institute of Brain Development](https://www.libd.org) and [University of Virginia](https://ace.virginia.edu/).

Prior coming to JHU I graduated with First Class Honours from the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/). During my undergrad, I was involved in a number of research projects at Jadavpur University, India and [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/), Canada.
I am passionate about merging the gap between machine learning and the scientific domain by fusing *a priori* scientific information about real-world datasets with data-driven approaches.
